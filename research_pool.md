Click [here](https://rsameni.github.io/Research/Pool/Report.pdf) for a list of open-problems that I have been working on, or have came across during my career. Most of them are in the field of statistical signal processing (especially for biomedical applications) and digital system design, which are my major fields of research. Some of these topics have already been defined as projects for my students, on which we have had partial progress. If you are interested in working on any of these subjects under my direction or as a joint research, please feel free to contact me for further details and references. I also welcome any feedback on these topics, or references to people or websites, which have partially or fully solved any of these problems.
