  abstract = {We present generalizations of our previously published artificial models for generating multi-channel ECG so that the simulation of abnormal rhythms is possible. Using a three-dimensional vectorcardiogram (VCG) formulation, we generate the normal cardiac dipole for a patient using a sum of Gaussian kernels, fitted to real VCG recordings. Abnormal beats are then specified either as new dipoles, or as perturbations of the existing dipole. Switching between normal and abnormal beat types is achieved using a hidden Markov model (HMM). Probability transitions can be learned from real data or modeled by coupling to heart rate and sympathovagal balance. Natural morphology changes form beat-to-beat are incorporated as before from varying the angular frequency of the dipole as a function of the inter-beat (RR) interval. The RR interval time series is generated using our previously described model whereby time-and frequency-domain heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) characteristics can be specified. QT-HR hysteresis is simulated by coupling the Gaussian kernels associated with the T-wave in the model with a nonlinear factor related to the local HR (determined from the last N RR intervals). Morphology changes due to respiration are simulated by coupling the RR interval to the angular frequency of the dipole. We demonstrate an example of the use of this model by simulating T-Wave Alternans (TWA). The magnitude of the TWA effect is modeled as a disturbance on the T-loop of the dipole with a magnitude that differs in each of the three VCG planes. The effect is then turned on or off using a HMM. The values of the transition matrix are determined by the local heart rate, such that when the HR ramps up towards 100 BPM, the probability of a TWA effect rapidly but smoothly increases. In this way, no 'sudden' switching from non-TWA to TWA is observed, and the natural tendency for TWA to be associated with a critical HR-related activation level is simulated. Finally, to generate multi-lead signals, the VCG is mapped to any set of clinical leads using a Dower-like transform derived from a least-squares optimization between known VCGs and known lead morphologies. ECGs with calibrated amounts of TWA were generated by this model and included in the PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2008 data set.}

  abstract = {The problem of blind source separation (BSS) and tracking from time-varying mixtures is an open-problem of biomedical signal processing research. In this study we present a framework for decomposing and tracking instantaneous separation matrices of independent component analysis (ICA) solutions of BSS. The decomposition is based on the tracking of the second order statistics (SOS) and higher order statistic (HOS) stages of ICA. We investigate the variations of data subspaces by means of tracking the principal angle and Givens rotation angles of the instantaneous mixture. The application of this technique is illustrated for electrocardiogram signals. We shown how the SOS and HOS variations of time-varying mixtures can be decoupled and may correspond to the second and higher order properties of the data. This new approach is believed to have various advantages for online subspace tracking in blind and semi-blind scenarios and the better examination of statistic characteristics of multichannel data, especially for biosignal processing.},

The method is based on a modified nonlinear dynamic model, previously introduced for the generation of synthetic ECG signals. We have suggested simple dynamics as the governing equations for the model parameters. Since we have not any observation for these new state variables, they are considered as hidden states. Quantitative evaluation of the proposed algorithm on the MIT-BIH signals shows that an average SNR improvement of 12 dB is achieved for a signal of -5 dB. The results show improved output SNRs compared to the EKF outputs in the absence of these new dynamics.},

  abstract = {In this paper the cardiac phase is calculated using different methods based on time warping theory. The estimated phase is used for calculation of the heart rate (HR) signal. The results show that the estimated HR is similar to the HR calculated by using the RR-interval sequence. Unlike the RR-interval signal which is non-uniformly sampled, the proposed method for HR calculation is continuous in time. Therefore, conventional signal processing methods can be used to study the HR signal easily and without any preprocessing techniques like resampling and interpolations used in previous method.},
