Our approach takes advantage of the non-stationarity nature of the EEG signal using a time-varying autoregressive model. The time-varying coefficients of autoregressive model are estimated using the Kalman filter. The results show considerable improvement in signal-to-noise ratio and significant reduction of the number of false positives.}

  Abstract                 = {Combined EEG/fMRI recording has been used to localize the generators of EEG events and to identify subject state in cognitive studies and is of increasing interest. However, the large EEG artifacts induced during fMRI have precluded simultaneous EEG and fMRI recording, restricting study design. Removing this artifact is difficult, as it normally exceeds EEG significantly and contains components in the EEG frequency range. We have developed a recording system and an artifact reduction method that reduce this artifact effectively. The recording system has large dynamic range to capture both low-amplitude EEG and large imaging artifact without distortion (resolution 2 microV, range 33.3 mV), 5-kHz sampling, and low-pass filtering prior to the main gain stage. Imaging artifact is reduced by subtracting an averaged artifact waveform, followed by adaptive noise cancellation to reduce any residual artifact. This method was validated in recordings from five subjects using periodic and continuous fMRI sequences. Spectral analysis revealed differences of only 10 to 18\% between EEG recorded in the scanner without fMRI and the corrected EEG. Ninety-nine percent of spike waves (median 74 microV) added to the recordings were identified in the corrected EEG compared to 12\% in the uncorrected EEG. The median noise after artifact reduction was 8 microV. All these measures indicate that most of the artifact was removed, with minimal EEG distortion. Using this recording system and artifact reduction method, we have demonstrated that simultaneous EEG/fMRI studies are for the first time possible, extending the scope of EEG/fMRI studies considerably.}

  Abstract                 = {Triggering functional MRI (fMRI) image acquisition immediately after an EEG event can provide information on the location of the event generator. However, EEG artifact associated with pulsatile blood flow in a subject inside the scanner may obscure EEG events. This pulse artifact (PA) has been widely recognized as a significant problem, although its characteristics are unpredictable. We have investigated the amplitude, distribution on the scalp, and frequency of occurrence of this artifact. This showed large interindividual variations in amplitude, although PA is normally largest in the frontal region. In five of six subjects, PA was greater than 50 ?V in at least one of the temporal, parasagittal, and central channels analyzed. Therefore, we developed and validated a method for removing PA. This subtracts an averaged PA waveform calculated for each electrode during the previous 10 s. Particular attention has been given to reliable ECG peak detection and ensuring that the average PA waveform is free of other EEG artifacts. Comparison of frequency spectra for EEG recorded outside and inside the scanner, with and without PA subtraction, showed a clear reduction in artifact after PA subtraction for all four frequency ranges analyzed. As further validation, lateralized epileptiform spikes were added to recordings from inside and outside the scanner: PA subtraction significantly increased the proportion of these spikes that were correctly identified and decreased the number of false spike detections. We conclude that in some subjects, EEG/fMRI studies will be feasible only using PA subtraction.}

Quarter-second windows of six-channel {EEG} were transformed into four different representations: scalar AR model coefficients, multivariate AR coefficients, eigenvalues of a correlation matrix, and the Karhunen-Lo�ve transform of the multivariate AR coefficients. Feature vectors defined by these representations were classified with a standard, feedforward neural network trained via the error backpropagation algorithm. The four representations produced similar results, with the multivariate AR coefficients performing slightly better and more consistently with an average classification accuracy of 91.4\% on novel, untrained, {EEG} signals.},

The HMM framework has been visited because of its ability of beat detection, segmentation and classification, highly suitable to the electrocardiogram (ECG) problem. Our approach addresses a large panel of topics some of them never studied before in other HMM related works: waveforms modeling, multichannel beat segmentation and classification, and unsupervised adaptation to the patient's ECG. The performance was evaluated on the two-channel QT database in terms of waveform segmentation precision, beat detection and classification. Our waveform segmentation results compare favorably to other systems in the literature. We also obtained high beat detection performance with sensitivity of 99.79% and a positive predictivity of 99.96%, using a test set of 59 recordings. Moreover, premature ventricular contraction beats were detected using an original classification strategy. The results obtained validate our approach for real world application},

A method was recently presented which reduces the influence of such noise by performing spatial and temporal alignment of VCG loops. The alignment is performed in terms of scaling, rotation and time synchronization of the loops. Using an ECG simulation model based on propagation of action potentials in cardiac tissue, the ability of the method to separate morphologic variability of physiological origin from respiratory activity was studied. Morphologic variability was created by introducing a random variation in action potential propagation between different compartments. The results indicate that the separation of these two activities can be done accurately at low to moderate noise levels (less than 10 /spl mu/V). At high noise levels, the estimation of the rotation angles was found to break down in an abrupt manner. It was also shown that the breakdown noise level is strongly dependent on loop morphology; a planar loop corresponds to a lower breakdown noise level than does a nonplanar loop.},

  Abstract = {The powerline interference reduction in ECG records is a challenging problem which is still open for research. The powerline signal, measured directly from the transmission line may have amplitude, phase and frequency variations. These reasons make the classical filtering methods sub-optimal in the powerline interference reduction. We propose a tracking method based on Kalman filtering which uses an state space model for the noisy signal and allows adequate discrimination between the ECG signal and the perturbation, even during non-stationarities. The parameters of this algorithm are optimized via genetic algorithms, obtaining a set of values that give it a mean correlation index on the QT database over 0,99.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To quantify accurately in utero fetal liver, brain and placental volumes using echo planar imaging, and to assess whether the technique has the potential to enhance intrauterine fetal assessment. DESIGN: Thirty-two singleton, complicated pregnancies were scanned using echo planar imaging, a form of magnetic resonance imaging. Pregnancies were subdivided on the basis of whether the fetus was found subsequently to have an individualised birthweight ratio above (n = 21) or below (n = 11) the 10th centile. Comparisons of the organ volumes of these two groups were made. RESULTS: The first quantitative in utero measurement of fetal liver volume showed a linear relation between liver volume and gestational age in fetuses where the individualised birthweight ratio was above the 10th centile (the normal growth group). Ten of the 11 liver volume measurements of fetuses subsequently found to have an individualised birthweight ratio below the 10th centile fell on or outside the 95\% confidence limits established for the normal growth group. In contrast, no such differences were demonstrated when the brain and placental volumes were considered, with 10 of the 11 brain measurements and all of the 11 placental measurements falling within the 95\% confidence limits of the normal growth group. CONCLUSIONS: A single measurement of fetal liver volume using echo planar imaging enabled accurate identification of fetuses subsequently found to have individualised birthweight ratios below the 10th centile. If these findings are repeated in larger, more representative studies, this suggests that the technique has the potential to contribute to intrauterine fetal assessment.},

Although we use the concept of sequential blind extraction of sources and independent component analysis, we do not carry out the extraction in a completely blind manner; neither do we assume that sources are statistically independent. In fact, we show that the a priori information about the autocorrelation function of primary sources can be used to extract the desired signals (sources of interest) from their linear mixtures. Extensive computer simulations and real data application experiments confirm the validity and high performance of the proposed algorithm.},

  Abstract                 = {Non-invasive fetal electrocardiography (NI-FECG) is a promising alternative continuous fetal monitoring method that has the potential to allow morphological analysis of the FECG. However, there are a number of challenges associated with the evaluation of morphological parameters from the NI-FECG, including low signal to noise ratio of the NI-FECG and methodological challenges for getting reference annotations and evaluating the accuracy of segmentation algorithms. This work aims to validate the measurement of the fetal QT interval in term laboring women using a NI-FECG electrocardiogram monitor. Fetal electrocardiogram data were recorded from 22 laboring women at term using the NI-FECG and an invasive fetal scalp electrode simultaneously. A total of 105 one-minute epochs were selected for analysis. Three pediatric electrophysiologists independently annotated individual waveforms and averaged waveforms from each epoch. The intervals measured on the averaged cycles taken from the NI-FECG and the fetal scalp electrode showed a close agreement; the root mean square error between all corresponding averaged NI-FECG and fetal scalp electrode beats was 13.6ms, which is lower than the lowest adult root mean square error of 16.1?ms observed in related adult QT studies. These results provide evidence that NI-FECG technology enables accurate extraction of the fetal QT interval.},

We propose the estimation of the orthonormal transformation matrix Q in the case of whitened observations and a cost function based on the fourth-order moments. Q is described as combination of elementary Givens rotations and the optimization is carried out jointly for all the rotations. When sub-sets of angles are optimized separately the method reduces to the deflation approach which has been proved to be globally convergent. The joint estimation of Givens rotation matrices has a computational complexity O(7N2) and, compared to other adaptive BSS, simulations demonstrate that it converges faster and achieves a better crosstalk attenuation},

  Abstract                 = {Fetal motility is a widely accepted indicator of the well-being of a fetus. In previous research, it has be shown that fetal motion (FM) is coherent with fetal heart rate accelerations and an indicator for active/rest cycles of the fetus. The most common approach for FM and fetal heart rate (FHR) assessment is by Doppler ultrasound (DUS). While DUS is the most common approach for studying the mechanical activities of the heart, noninvasive fetal electrocardiogram (ECG) and magnetocardiogram (MCG) recording and processing techniques have been considered as a possible competitor (or complement) for the DUS. In this study, a fully automatic and robust framework is proposed for the extraction, ranking and alignment of fetal QRS-complexes from noninvasive fetal ECG/MCG. Using notions from subspace tracking, two measures, namely the actogram and rotatogram , are defined for fetal motion tracking. The method is applied to four fetal ECG/MCG databases, including twin MCG recordings. By defining a novel measure of causality, it is shown that there is significant coherency and causal relationship between the actogram/rotatogram and FHR accelerations/decelerations. Using this measure, it is shown that in many cases, the actogram and rotatogram precede the FHR variations, which supports the idea of motion-induced FHR accelerations/decelerations for these cases and raises attention for the non-motion-induced FHR variations, which can be associated to the fetal central nervous system developments. The results of this study can lead to novel perspectives of the fetal sympathetic and parasympathetic brain systems and future requirements of fetal cardiac monitoring.},

  Abstract                 = {Background Knowledge of fetal oxygen saturation, as an adjunct to electronic fetal monitoring, may be associated with a significant change in the rate of cesarean deliveries or the infant's condition at birth. Methods We randomly assigned 5341 nulliparous women who were at term and in early labor to either "open" or "masked" fetal pulse oximetry. In the open group, fetal oxygen saturation values were displayed to the clinician. In the masked group, the fetal oxygen sensor was inserted and the values were recorded by computer, but the data were hidden. Labor complicated by a nonreassuring fetal heart rate before randomization was documented for subsequent analysis. Results There was no significant difference in the overall rates of cesarean delivery between the open and masked groups (26.3% and 27.5%, respectively; P=0.31). The rates of cesarean delivery associated with the separate indications of a nonreassuring fetal heart rate (7.1% and 7.9%, respectively; P=0.30) and dystocia (18.6% and 19.2%, respectively; P=0.59) were similar between the two groups. Similar findings were observed in the subgroup of 2168 women in whom a nonreassuring fetal heart rate was detected before randomization. The condition of the infants at birth did not differ significantly between the two groups. Conclusions Knowledge of the fetal oxygen saturation is not associated with a reduction in the rate of cesarean delivery or with improvement in the condition of the newborn.

Thus the 95\% confidence interval covered the range of 1/2.57 to 2.57 times the mean volume at any given gestational age. Contrary to expected trends, mean amniotic fluid volume did not change significantly between 22 and 39 weeks and averaged 777 ml, with the 95\% confidence interval ranging from 302 to 1997 ml.

  Abstract                 = {Neural activity in the brain is accompanied by changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and blood oxygenation that are detectable with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques. In this paper, recent mathematical models of this hemodynamic response are reviewed and integrated. Models are described for: (1) the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal as a function of changes in cerebral oxygen extraction fraction (E) and cerebral blood volume (CBV); (2) the balloon model, proposed to describe the transient dynamics of CBV and deoxy-hemoglobin (Hb) and how they affect the BOLD signal; (3) neurovascular coupling, relating the responses in CBF and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) to the neural activity response; and (4) a simple model for the temporal nonlinearity of the neural response itself. These models are integrated into a mathematical framework describing the steps linking a stimulus to the measured BOLD and CBF responses. Experimental results examining transient features of the BOLD response (post-stimulus undershoot and initial dip), nonlinearities of the hemodynamic response, and the role of the physiologic baseline state in altering the BOLD signal are discussed in the context of the proposed models. Quantitative modeling of the hemodynamic response, when combined with experimental data measuring both the BOLD and CBF responses, makes possible a more specific and quantitative assessment of brain physiology than is possible with standard BOLD imaging alone. This approach has the potential to enhance numerous studies of brain function in development, health, and disease.},

The project started in 1981 and is close to producing a prototype personal computer-based system. This records simultaneously a number of cutaneous potential signals and derives from this set one or more maternal electrocardiogram-free fetal heart signals, by combining linearly the recorded signals. An on-line adaptive algorithm based on the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) has been designed to compute the coefficients in these linear combinations. This algorithm will be implemented on a DSP board that can be plugged into the real-time recording system. The system will be very useful in studies of the fetal electrocardiogram during pregnancy but also in all other studies such as fetal heart rate variability, fetal movements, etc., where a precise trigger of the electrical signal from the fetal heart is required.},

Typically, the linear systems obtained have to be regularized to make the computation of a meaningful approximate solution possible. Tikhonov regularization is one of the most popular regularization methods. A regularization parameter specifies the amount of regularization and, in general, an appropriate value of this parameter is not known a priori. We review available iterative methods, and present new ones, for the determination of a suitable value of the regularization parameter by the L-curve criterion and the solution of regularized systems of algebraic equations.},

  Abstract                 = {Source separation consists of recovering a set of independent signals when only mixtures with unknown coefficients are observed. This paper introduces a class of adaptive algorithms for source separation that implements an adaptive version of equivariant estimation and is henceforth called equivariant adaptive separation via independence (EASI). The EASI algorithms are based on the idea of serial updating. This specific form of matrix updates systematically yields algorithms with a simple structure for both real and complex mixtures. Most importantly, the performance of an EASI algorithm does not depend on the mixing matrix. In particular, convergence rates, stability conditions, and interference rejection levels depend only on the (normalized) distributions of the source signals. Closed-form expressions of these quantities are given via an asymptotic performance analysis. The theme of equivariance is stressed throughout the paper. The source separation problem has an underlying multiplicative structure. The parameter space forms a (matrix) multiplicative group. We explore the (favorable) consequences of this fact on implementation, performance, and optimization of EASI algorithms},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we demonstrate the usefulness of an eigenvector based spatial filtering method for signal processing of multi-channel fetal magnetocardiogram (fMCG) and fetal magnetoencephalogram (fMEG) recordings. This method of filtering can separate signal and interference by exploiting the considerable spatial information contained in multi-channel recordings. Typically, fMCGs and fMEGs suffer from large cardiac interference and low signal-to-noise ratio. To isolate the signal from the interference, we identify their respective subspaces using one portion of the record dominated by the signal and another dominated by the interference. Each subspace is approximately rank two since the sources of the signal and interference can be modeled as current dipoles. The spatial filter consists of a linear transformation that preserves the signal subspace and annihilates the interference subspace. It is easier to implement than a matched filter, preserves the morphology and topography of the fetal signal, and effectively removes maternal cardiac interference, even when the maternal and fetal complexes overlap strongly in time or when small maternal movements or maternal arrhythmias alter the temporal character of the interference.},

  Abstract                 = {We present generalizations of our previously published artificial models for generating multi-channel ECG so that the simulation of abnormal rhythms is possible. Using a three-dimensional vectorcardiogram (VCG) formulation, we generate the normal cardiac dipole for a patient using a sum of Gaussian kernels, fitted to real VCG recordings. Abnormal beats are then specified either as new dipoles, or as perturbations of the existing dipole. Switching between normal and abnormal beat types is achieved using a hidden Markov model (HMM). Probability transitions can be learned from real data or modeled by coupling to heart rate and sympathovagal balance. Natural morphology changes form beat-to-beat are incorporated as before from varying the angular frequency of the dipole as a function of the inter-beat (RR) interval. The RR interval time series is generated using our previously described model whereby time-and frequency-domain heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) characteristics can be specified. QT-HR hysteresis is simulated by coupling the Gaussian kernels associated with the T-wave in the model with a nonlinear factor related to the local HR (determined from the last N RR intervals). Morphology changes due to respiration are simulated by coupling the RR interval to the angular frequency of the dipole. We demonstrate an example of the use of this model by simulating T-Wave Alternans (TWA). The magnitude of the TWA effect is modeled as a disturbance on the T-loop of the dipole with a magnitude that differs in each of the three VCG planes. The effect is then turned on or off using a HMM. The values of the transition matrix are determined by the local heart rate, such that when the HR ramps up towards 100 BPM, the probability of a TWA effect rapidly but smoothly increases. In this way, no 'sudden' switching from non-TWA to TWA is observed, and the natural tendency for TWA to be associated with a critical HR-related activation level is simulated. Finally, to generate multi-lead signals, the VCG is mapped to any set of clinical leads using a Dower-like transform derived from a least-squares optimization between known VCGs and known lead morphologies. ECGs with calibrated amounts of TWA were generated by this model and included in the PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2008 data set.}

Strobach et al., ibid., vol. 41, p. 343-50 (1994) as a specific application of the well known "adaptive noise canceller" (ANC) paradigm, but ESC uses a simple adaptive gain control (AGC) instead of the complex adaptive filter of the ANC. The proposed ESC method is evaluated using both computer simulations and real EMGdi data, and its efficiency in interference cancellation is compared to that of ESAIC. Of particular interest is the result that the ESC can replace the ESAIC providing better performance as well as a considerable reduction of computational costs.},

We show that both internal and external electromyograms occur in phase with intrauterine pressure increase and exhibit similar spectra, including a slow wave (0.01 < frequency < 0.03 Hz) probably because of mechanical artifacts and a fast wave whose frequency content can be subdivided into a low-frequency band always present in every contraction and a high-frequency band related to efficient parturition contractions. Application of classic spectral techniques to electromyogram envelopes has identified group propagation but not pacemaker areas. However, no time delay or classic propagation has been demonstrated by applying the same spectral techniques to the electromyogram itself, probably because of the nonlinearity and three-dimensional nature of the propagating process.},

  Abstract                 = {Stein's unbiased risk estimate (SURE) was proposed by Stein for the independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian model in order to derive estimates that dominate least squares (LS). Recently, the SURE criterion has been employed in a variety of denoising problems for choosing regularization parameters that minimize an estimate of the mean-squared error (MSE). However, its use has been limited to the i.i.d. case which precludes many important applications. In this paper we begin by deriving a SURE counterpart for general, not necessarily i.i.d. distributions from the exponential family. This enables extending the SURE design technique to a much broader class of problems. Based on this generalization we suggest a new method for choosing regularization parameters in penalized LS estimators. We then demonstrate its superior performance over the conventional generalized cross validation and discrepancy approaches in the context of image deblurring and deconvolution. The SURE technique can also be used to design estimates without predefining their structure. However, allowing for too many free parameters impairs the estimate's performance. To address this inherent tradeoff, we propose a regularized SURE objective, and demonstrate its use in the context of wavelet denoising.},

  abstract = {The temperature dependence of SQUID noise was tested over a temperature range from 0.3-4 K for SQUID's of three different manufactures, two designed for user supplied pick-up coils and one a magnetometer. A SQUID-based picovoltmeter, designed to reduce noise contributions for cables and electronics was used to read out the signal from the SQUID being investigated. The data were taken in support of a physics experiment which will use SQUID's to measure the precession frequency of spin polarized 3He, acting as a comagnetometer with spin polarized ultra cold neutrons (UCN). The final aim of the experiment is to measure the neutron electric dipole moment to 4 times;10-28 ecm. The 3He and UCN will be in a bath at temperatures <0.5 K. The noise performance of the SQUID's at these temperatures must be well understood before the experiment. The results of the noise studies as a function of temperature are presented for the three SQUID's and their behavior is compared to theoretical predictions based on SQUID parameters.},

  Abstract                 = {The problem of blind source separation (BSS) and tracking from time-varying mixtures is an open-problem of biomedical signal processing research. In this study we present a framework for decomposing and tracking instantaneous separation matrices of independent component analysis (ICA) solutions of BSS. The decomposition is based on the tracking of the second order statistics (SOS) and higher order statistic (HOS) stages of ICA. We investigate the variations of data subspaces by means of tracking the principal angle and Givens rotation angles of the instantaneous mixture. The application of this technique is illustrated for electrocardiogram signals. We shown how the SOS and HOS variations of time-varying mixtures can be decoupled and may correspond to the second and higher order properties of the data. This new approach is believed to have various advantages for online subspace tracking in blind and semi-blind scenarios and the better examination of statistic characteristics of multichannel data, especially for biosignal processing.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates a new method for eliminating sinusoidal or other periodic interference corrupting a signal. This task is typically accomplished by explicitly measuring the frequency of the interference and implementing a notch filter at that frequency. The method proposed herein uses an adaptive filter to eliminate the interference. The procedure is called adaptive noise canceling and is applicable when an auxiliary reference input is available containing the interference alone. The reference input is filtered in such a way that it closely matches the interfering sinusoid, and is then subtracted from the primary input leaving the signal alone. The results of this research show that when a sum of sinusoids is applied to an adaptive filter, the filter converges to a dynamic solution in which the weights of the filter are time varying. This time-varying solution implements a tunable notch filter, with a notch located at each of the reference frequencies. When used in noise-canceling applications, this adaptive notch filter provides a simple alternative to other methods of tracking and eliminating sinusoidal interferences.},

  Abstract                 = {The present data, obtained from chronically instrumented fetal lambs, includes three fetuses monitored throughout spontaneous labour, six fetuses with spontaneously developed long-term ST waveform changes and another three fetuses which died in the post-operative period. Uterine contractions could by themselves cause an increase in T wave height (T/QRS ratio$>$0.30). If the ST elevation was normalised between contractions the fetus seemed to compensate to a moderate degree of hypoxia. When oxygenation was further reduced the T wave remained elevated between contractions and a progressive increase occurred in the T/QRS ratio ($>$0.60) during the final stages of labour, in parallel with increasing blood lactate levels. Death in utero, whatever the cause (bleeding, infection or spontaneous hypoxia), was always preceded by marked ST waveform changes. It is concluded that ST elevation with high peaked T waves can appear on a long-term basis in fetuses with intrauterine complications.},

We evaluated the performance of the two implementations with respect to adaptation rate (or transient response time), signal distortion, and implementation complexity. We also investigated the relative effect of adaptive and nonadaptive 60-Hz filtering on ECG data compression. With a 360 Hz sample rate and an adaptation time of approximately 0.3 s for a 1 mV 60-Hz signal, the adaptive implementation is less complex and introduces less noise, particularly in the ST-segment, into a typical ECG signal. When applied to ECG signals, prior to data compression by average beat subtraction and residual differencing, the residual signal resulting from the adaptively filtered signal had an average entropy 0.31 bits per sample (bps) lower than the unfiltered signal. The nonadaptive 60-Hz filter produced an average entropy decrease of 0.08 bps relative to the unfiltered ECG},

At the same time, recent studies have statistically confirmed the non-stationarity of genomic non-numeric sequences and suggested the use of non-stationary analysis for these sequences. The conventional approach to analyze non-numeric genomic sequences using techniques specific to numerical data is to convert non-numerical data into numerical values in some way and then apply time or transform domain signal processing algorithms. Nevertheless, this approach raises questions regarding the relative magnitudes under numeric transforms, which can potentially lead to spurious patterns or misinterpretation of results.},

They require no multipliers and use limited storage making them an economical alternative to conventional implementations for certain applications. A digital filter in this class consists of cascaded ideal integrator stages operating at a high sampling rate and an equal number of comb stages operating at a low sampling rate. Together, a single integrator-comb pair produces a uniform FIR. The number of cascaded integrator-comb pairs is chosen to meet design requirements for aliasing or imaging error. Design procedures and examples are given for both decimation and interpolation filters with the emphasis on frequency response and register width.},

Spatial filters based on artifact and brain signal topographies can remove artifacts completely without distortion of relevant brain activity. The authors describe the basic principle of artifact correction by spatial filtering and they review different approaches to estimate artifact and brain signal topographies. The main focus is on the preselection approach, which is fast enough to be applied while paging through the segments of a digital EEG recording. Examples of real EEG segments, containing epileptic seizure activity or interictal spikes contaminated by artifacts, show that spatial filtering by preselection can be a useful tool during EEG review. Advantages and disadvantages of the different spatial filter approaches are discussed.},

A new approach is proposed, which is particularly advantageous when the mixing environment is noisy and time-varying, and that is shown, analytically and in simulation, to improve the convergence rate of the natural gradient algorithm. The distribution of the wavelet coefficients of the source signals is then modeled by a generalized Gaussian probability density, whereby in the time-scale domain the problem of selecting appropriate nonlinearities when separating mixtures of both sub- and super-Gaussian signals is mitigated, as shown by experimental results.},

ECG data compression schemes are presented in two major groups: direct data compression and transformation methods. The direct data compression techniques are ECG differential pulse code modulation (DPCM) and entropy coding, AZTEC, Turning-point, CORTES, Fan and SAPA algorithms, peak-picking, and cycle-to-cycle compression methods. The transformation methods include Fourier, Walsh, and Karhunen-Loeve transforms. The theoretical bases behind the direct ECG data compression schemes are presented and classified into three categories: tolerance-comparison compression, DPCM, and entropy coding methods. A framework for evaluation and comparison of ECG compression schemes is presented.},

  Abstract                 = {The modeling of nonstationary electroencephalogram (EEG) with time-varying autoregressive (TVAR) models is discussed. The classical least squares TVAR approach is modified so that prior assumptions about the signal can be taken into account in an optimal way. The method is then applied to the estimation of event-related synchronization changes in the EEG. The results show that the new approach enables effective estimation of the parameter evolution of the time-varying EEG with better time resolution compared to previous methods. The new method also allows single-trial analysis of the event-related synchronization.},

Conversely, densely sampled full ECG recordings possess properties typical of deterministic signals.

It is based on statistical analysis of the QRS interval sequences. Beat-to-beat variation is characterized by a differential index (DI) and long-term variation by an interval index (II). The effect of the sample time on the DI is minimal, and hence the DI can be calculated from rather short samples. The II is more sensitive to FHR trends and should be calculated from longer samples, but between the periodic changes, accelerations, and decelerations. Variable amounts of detection pulses are lost in both methods. The DI is sensitive to the missing intervals; no analysis result should be accepted if the number of lost intervals exceeds 10 per cent. The II is less sensitive to the number of missing intervals. The means and standard deviations of the variability indices for eight fetuses during pregnancy and for five fetuses during labor are presented.},

  Abstract                 = {The career of Jim Zimmerman, beginning with a solid foundation in electronics and cryogenics, reached a turning point in 1965 when he became coinventor of the rf SQUID (Superconducting QUantum Interference Device), while working at the Scientific Laboratory of the Ford Motor Company in Dearborn, Michigan. Recognizing the exquisite sensitivity of the SQUID as an amplifier and magnetometer, Zimmerman devoted the remainder of his career, at Ford and later at the National Bureau of Standards, to the further development of the SQUID and its applications. In 1969, Zimmerman also helped found SHE Corporation, which marketed the first commercially successful SQUID. While at NBS, Zimmerman introduced two variations, the SQUID gradiometer and the fractional-turn SQUID, to enhance the sensitivity of SQUIDs in special situations. He also developed an improved understanding of SQUID dynamics by exploring the pendulum analog using carefully made models, work that has benefited a generation of students. Putting the SQUID to work, Zimmerman investigated applications in metrology, biomagnetism, and geophysics. Notably, he participated in collaborations that recorded the first magnetocardiogram made with a SQUID and the first magnetoencephalogram of an evoked auditory response. Later, Zimmerman explored closed-cycle refrigeration as a means of making SQUIDs more useful outside the laboratory environment, and in 1977 he demonstrated an operating SQUID cooled to 8.5 K by a Stirling-cycle refrigerator made largely of plastic. Zimmerman is remembered for his keen physical insight, the elegance and simplicity of his experiments, and his willingness to question conventional wisdom in all aspects of life},

  Abstract                 = {The paper introduces an improved signal decomposition model-based Bayesian framework (EKS6). While it can be employed for multiple purposes, like denoising and features extraction, it is particularly suited for extracting electrocardiogram (ECG) wave-forms from ECG recordings. In this framework, the ECG is represented as the sum of several components, each describing a specific wave (i.e., P, Q, R, S, and T), with a corresponding term in the dynamical model. Characteristic Waveforms (CWs) of the ECG components are taken as hidden state variables, distinctly estimated using a Kalman smoother from sample to sample. Then, CWs can be analyzed separately, accordingly to a specific application. The new dynamical model no longer depends on the amplitude of the Gaussian kernels, so it is capable of separating ECG components even if sudden changes in the CWs appear (e.g., an ectopic beat). Results, obtained on synthetic signals with different levels of noise, showed that the proposed method is indeed more effective in separating the ECG components when compared with another framework recently introduced with the same aims (EKS4). The proposed approach can be used for many applications. In this paper, we verified it for T/QRS ratio calculation. For this purpose, we applied it to 288 signals from the PhysioNet PTB Diagnostic ECG Database. The values of RMSE obtained show that the T/QRS ratio computed on the components extracted from the ECG, corrupted by broadband noise, is closer to the original T/QRS ratio values ( RMSE=0.025 for EKS6 and 0.17 for EKS4).},

  Abstract                 = {Linear ICA model with additive Gaussian noise is frequently considered in many practical applications, because it approaches the reality often much better than the noise-free alternate. In this paper, a number important differences between noisy and noiseless ICA are discussed. It is shown that estimation of the mixing/demixing matrix should not be the main goal, in the noisy case. Instead, it is proposed to compare the outcome of ICA algorithms with a minimum mean square (MMSE) separation, derived for known mixing model. The signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio is suggested as the most meaningful performance criterion. A simulation study that compares a few well known ICA algorithms applied to noise data is included},

  Abstract                 = {Savitzky-Golay (S-G) filters are finite impulse response lowpass filters obtained while smoothing data using a local least-squares (LS) polynomial approximation. Savitzky and Golay proved in their hallmark paper that local LS fitting of polynomials and their evaluation at the mid-point of the approximation interval is equivalent to filtering with a fixed impulse response. The problem that we address here is, ?how to choose a pointwise minimum mean squared error (MMSE) S-G filter length or order for smoothing, while preserving the temporal structure of a time-varying signal.? We solve the bias-variance tradeoff involved in the MMSE optimization using Stein's unbiased risk estimator (SURE). We observe that the 3-dB cutoff frequency of the SURE-optimal S-G filter is higher where the signal varies fast locally, and vice versa, essentially enabling us to suitably trade off the bias and variance, thereby resulting in near-MMSE performance. At low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), it is seen that the adaptive filter length algorithm performance improves by incorporating a regularization term in the SURE objective function. We consider the algorithm performance on real-world electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. The results exhibit considerable SNR improvement. Noise performance analysis shows that the proposed algorithms are comparable, and in some cases, better than some standard denoising techniques available in the literature.},

Based upon wide experience, it will be useful to survey the status of fetal electrocardiography, pointing out the possibilities as well as limitations. The significance in terms of capability for early study of the developing heart, the diagnosis of fetal life, multiple pregnancy, origins of congenital heart disease, as well as the study of intrauterine difficulties as in labor is presented and discussed in detail. On the basis of a discussion of present-day instruments and the types of "noise" encountered, it is suggested that improved low-noise amplifiers are desirable; it is suggested further that the use of averaging, correlation, and other computer-based techniques may hold substantial promise. 9152.},

  Abstract                 = {Cameras are ubiquitous everywhere and hold the promise of significantly changing the way we live and interact with our environment. Human activity recognition is central to understanding dynamic scenes for applications ranging from security surveillance, to assisted living for the elderly, to video gaming without controllers. Most current approaches to solve this problem are based in the use of local temporal-spatial features that limit their ability to recognize long and complex actions. In this paper, we propose a new approach to exploit the temporal information encoded in the data. The main idea is to model activities as the output of unknown dynamic systems evolving from unknown initial conditions. Under this framework, we show that activity videos can be compared by computing the principal angles between subspaces representing activity types which are found by a simple SVD of the experimental data. The proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods classifying activities in the KTH dataset as well as in much more complex scenarios involving interacting actors.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:Within the intensive care unit (ICU), arterial blood pressure (ABP) is typically recorded at different (and sometimes uneven) sampling frequencies, and from different sensors, and is often corrupted by different artifacts and noise which are often non-Gaussian, nonlinear and nonstationary. Extracting robust parameters from such signals, and providing confidences in the estimates is therefore difficult and requires an adaptive filtering approach which accounts for artifact types.METHODS:Using a large ICU database, and over 6000 hours of simultaneously acquired electrocardiogram (ECG) and ABP waveforms sampled at 125 Hz from a 437 patient subset, we documented six general types of ABP artifact. We describe a new ABP signal quality index (SQI), based upon the combination of two previously reported signal quality measures weighted together. One index measures morphological normality, and the other degradation due to noise. After extracting a 6084-hour subset of clean data using our SQI, we evaluated a new robust tracking algorithm for estimating blood pressure and heart rate (HR) based upon a Kalman Filter (KF) with an update sequence modified by the KF innovation sequence and the value of the SQI. In order to do this, we have created six novel models of different categories of artifacts that we have identified in our ABP waveform data. These artifact models were then injected into clean ABP waveforms in a controlled manner. Clinical blood pressure (systolic, mean and diastolic) estimates were then made from the ABP waveforms for both clean and corrupted data. The mean absolute error for systolic, mean and diastolic blood pressure was then calculated for different levels of artifact pollution to provide estimates of expected errors given a single value of the SQI.RESULTS:Our artifact models demonstrate that artifact types have differing effects on systolic, diastolic and mean ABP estimates. We show that, for most artifact types, diastolic ABP estimates are less noise-sensitive than mean ABP estimates, which in turn are more robust than systolic ABP estimates. We also show that our SQI can provide error bounds for both HR and ABP estimates.CONCLUSION:The KF/SQI-fusion method described in this article was shown to provide an accurate estimate of blood pressure and HR derived from the ABP waveform even in the presence of high levels of persistent noise and artifact, and during extreme bradycardia and tachycardia. Differences in error between artifact types, measurement sensors and the quality of the source signal can be factored into physiological estimation using an unbiased adaptive filter, signal innovation and signal quality measures.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses underdetermined (i.e., with more sources than sensors) blind source separation (BSS) using a two-stage sparse representation approach. The first challenging task of this approach is to estimate precisely the unknown mixing matrix. In this paper, an algorithm for estimating the mixing matrix that can be viewed as an extension of the DUET and the TIFROM methods is first developed. Standard clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means method) also can be used for estimating the mixing matrix if the sources are sufficiently sparse. Compared with the DUET, the TIFROM methods, and standard clustering algorithms, with the authors' proposed method, a broader class of problems can be solved, because the required key condition on sparsity of the sources can be considerably relaxed. The second task of the two-stage approach is to estimate the source matrix using a standard linear programming algorithm. Another main contribution of the work described in this paper is the development of a recoverability analysis. After extending the results in , a necessary and sufficient condition for recoverability of a source vector is obtained. Based on this condition and various types of source sparsity, several probability inequalities and probability estimates for the recoverability issue are established. Finally, simulation results that illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results are presented.},

  Abstract                 = {In the past few decades, analysis of heart sound signals (i.e. the phonocardiogram or PCG), especially for automated heart sound segmentation and classification, has been widely studied and has been reported to have the potential value to detect pathology accurately in clinical applications. However, comparative analyses of algorithms in the literature have been hindered by the lack of high-quality, rigorously validated, and standardized open databases of heart sound recordings. This paper describes a public heart sound database, assembled for an international competition, the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology (CinC) Challenge 2016. The archive comprises nine different heart sound databases sourced from multiple research groups around the world. It includes 2435 heart sound recordings in total collected from 1297 healthy subjects and patients with a variety of conditions, including heart valve disease and coronary artery disease. The recordings were collected from a variety of clinical or nonclinical (such as in-home visits) environments and equipment. The length of recording varied from several seconds to several minutes. This article reports detailed information about the subjects/patients including demographics (number, age, gender), recordings (number, location, state and time length), associated synchronously recorded signals, sampling frequency and sensor type used. We also provide a brief summary of the commonly used heart sound segmentation and classification methods, including open source code provided concurrently for the Challenge. A description of the PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2016, including the main aims, the training and test sets, the hand corrected annotations for different heart sound states, the scoring mechanism, and associated open source code are provided. In addition, several potential benefits from the public heart sound database are discussed.},

METHODS: This prospective study evaluated the AF volume in singleton pregnancies undergoing amniocentesis for genetic assessment of fetal karyotype, preterm labor, or fetal lung maturity. Amniotic fluid volume was determined using a dye dilution technique. To assess the relationship between AF volume and estimated gestational age, a nonlinear regression model was applied. RESULTS: One hundred forty-four normal singleton pregnancies had AF volume evaluated. There was wide variability in the measured AF volumes with a significant (P < .01) increase in AF volume as a function of gestational age. Growth curve modeling estimated that AF volume continued to increase until 40 weeks' gestation. Analyses of the observed AF volume indicated that AF volume nearly doubled after 30 weeks' gestation. CONCLUSION: In contrast to other reports indicating that maximal AF volume in singleton gestations is expected early in the third trimester, we observed the attainment of maximal AF volume near term.},

  Abstract                 = {The simultaneous recording of EEG and fMRI is a promising method for combining the electrophysiological and hemodynamic information on cerebral dynamics. However, EEG recordings performed in the MRI scanner are contaminated by imaging, ballistocardiographic (BCG) and ocular artifacts. A number of processing techniques for the cancellation of fMRI environment disturbances exist: the most popular is averaged artifact subtraction (AAS), which performs well for the imaging artifact, but has some limitations in removing the BCG artifact, due to the variability in cardiac wave duration and shape; furthermore, no processing method to attenuate ocular artifact is currently used in EEG/fMRI, and contaminated epochs are simply rejected before signal analysis. In this work, we present a comprehensive method based on independent component analysis (ICA) for simultaneously removing BCG and ocular artifacts from the EEG recordings, as well as residual MRI contamination left by AAS. The ICA method has been tested on event-related potentials (ERPs) obtained from a visual oddball paradigm: it is very effective in attenuating artifacts in order to reconstruct clear brain signals from EEG acquired in the MRI scanner. It performs significantly better than the AAS method in removing the BCG artifact. Furthermore, since ocular artifacts can be completely suppressed, a larger number of trials is available for analysis. A comparison of ERPs inside the magnetic environment with those obtained out of the MRI scanner confirms that no systematic bias in the ERP waveform is produced by the ICA method.}

We propose an improved adaptive canceller for the reduction of the fundamental power line interference component and harmonics in electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. The method tracks the amplitude, phase, and frequency of all the interference components for power line frequency deviations up to about 4 Hz. A comparison is made between the performance of our method, former adaptive cancellers, and a narrow and a wide notch filter in suppressing the fundamental power line interference component. For this purpose a real ECG signal is corrupted by an artificial power line interference signal. The cleaned signal after applying all methods is compared with the original ECG signal. Our improved adaptive canceller shows a signal-to-power-line-interference ratio for the fundamental component up to 30 dB higher than that produced by the other methods. Moreover, our method is also effective for the suppression of the harmonics of the power line interference},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we propose a new method for FECG detection in abdominal recordings. The method consists of a sequential analysis approach, in which the a priori information about the interference signals is used for the detection of the FECG. Our method is evaluated on a set of 20 abdominal recordings from pregnant women with different gestational ages. Its performance in terms of fetal heart rate (FHR) detection success is compared with that of independent component analysis (ICA). The results show that our sequential estimation method outperforms ICA with a FHR detection rate of 85\% versus 60\% of ICA. The superior performance of our method is especially evident in recordings with a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This indicates that our method is more robust than ICA for FECG detection.},

  Abstract                 = {The maturation of fetal auditory evoked cortical responses (fAECRs) is an important aspect of developmental medicine, but their reliable identification is limited due to the technical restrictions in prenatal diagnosis. The signal-to-noise ratio of the fAECRs extracted exclusively from fetal magnetoencephalography is a known issue which limits their analysis as markers of brain development. The objective of this work was to develop a signal analysis strategy to address these problems and find appropriate processing steps. In this study, a group of 147 normal fetuses with gestations between 26 and 41 weeks underwent auditory evoked response testing. We combine different approaches that address data cleaning, fAECR determination and statistical fAECR validation to reduce the uncertainty in the detection of the auditory evoked responses. For the statistical validation of the evoked responses, we use parameters computed from bootstrap-based test statistics and the correlation between different averaging modes. Appropriate thresholds for those parameters are identified using linear regression analyses by looking at the maximum correlation coefficients. The results show that by using different validation parameters, the selected fAECRs conduct to similar regression slopes with an average of -13.6 ms/week gestational age which agree with previous studies. Our novel processing framework provides an objective way to identify and eliminate non-physiological variation in the data induced by artifacts. This approach has the potential to produce more reliable data needed in clinical studies for fetal brain maturation as well as extending the investigations to high-risk groups.},

  Abstract                 = {The environment in which the fetus develops is critical for its survival and long-term health. The regulation of normal human fetal growth involves many multidirectional interactions between the mother, placenta, and fetus. The mother supplies nutrients and oxygen to the fetus via the placenta. The fetus influences the provision of maternal nutrients via the placental production of hormones that regulate maternal metabolism. The placenta is the site of exchange between mother and fetus and regulates fetal growth via the production and metabolism of growth-regulating hormones such as IGFs and glucocorticoids. Adequate trophoblast invasion in early pregnancy and increased uteroplacental blood flow ensure sufficient growth of the uterus, placenta, and fetus. The placenta may respond to fetal endocrine signals to increase transport of maternal nutrients by growth of the placenta, by activation of transport systems, and by production of placental hormones to influence maternal physiology and even behavior. There are consequences of poor fetal growth both in the short term and long term, in the form of increased mortality and morbidity. Endocrine regulation of fetal growth involves interactions between the mother, placenta, and fetus, and these effects may program long-term physiology.},

  abstract = {The detection and estimation of signals in noisy, limited data is a problem of interest to many scientific and engineering communities. We present a mathematically justifiable, computationally simple, sample-eigenvalue-based procedure for estimating the number of high-dimensional signals in white noise using relatively few samples. The main motivation for considering a sample-eigenvalue-based scheme is the computational simplicity and the robustness to eigenvector modelling errors which can adversely impact the performance of estimators that exploit information in the sample eigenvectors. There is, however, a price we pay by discarding the information in the sample eigenvectors; we highlight a fundamental asymptotic limit of sample-eigenvalue-based detection of weak or closely spaced high-dimensional signals from a limited sample size. This motivates our heuristic definition of the effective number of identifiable signals which is equal to the number of ldquosignalrdquo eigenvalues of the population covariance matrix which exceed the noise variance by a factor strictly greater than . The fundamental asymptotic limit brings into sharp focus why, when there are too few samples available so that the effective number of signals is less than the actual number of signals, underestimation of the model order is unavoidable (in an asymptotic sense) when using any sample-eigenvalue-based detection scheme, including the one proposed herein. The analysis reveals why adding more sensors can only exacerbate the situation. Numerical simulations are used to demonstrate that the proposed estimator, like Wax and Kailath's MDL-based estimator, consistently estimates the true number of signals in the dimension fixed, large sample size limit and the effective number of identifiable signals, unlike Wax and Kailath's MDL-based estimator, in the large dimension, (relatively) large sample size limit.},

Two sessions on different days were recorded for eight subjects. Three different independent components analysis (ICA) algorithms (Infomax, FastICA and SOBI) were studied and compared to common spatial patterns (CSP), Laplacian derivations and standard bipolar derivations, which are other well-known preprocessing methods. Among the ICA algorithms, the best performance was achieved by Infomax when using all 22 components as well as for the selected 6 components. However, the performance of Laplacian derivations was comparable with Infomax for both cross-validated and unseen data. The overall best four-class classification accuracies (between 33\% and 84\%) were obtained with CSP. For the cross-validated training data, CSP performed slightly better than Infomax, whereas for unseen test data, CSP yielded significantly better classification results than Infomax in one of the sessions.},

The paper reports tests using Zibulevsky's method of temporal plotting to identify number of independent sources in SEMG recordings. The theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that sparse ICA is not suitable for SEMG signals. The results identify that the technique is unable to identify finite number of active muscles. The work demonstrates that even at extremely low level of muscle contraction, and with filtering using wavelets and band pass filters, it is not possible to get the data sparse enough to identify number of independent sources using Zibulevsky's sparse decomposition technique},

  Abstract                 = {Background Electronic monitoring of the fetal heart rate is commonly performed, in part to detect hypoxia during delivery that may result in brain injury. It is not known whether specific abnormalities on electronic fetal monitoring are related to the risk of cerebral palsy. Methods Among 155,636 children born from 1983 through 1985 in four California counties, we identified singleton infants with birth weights of at least 2500 g who survived to three years of age and had moderate or severe cerebral palsy. The children with cerebral palsy were compared with randomly selected control children with respect to characteristics noted in the birth records. Results Seventy-eight of 95 children with cerebral palsy and 300 of 378 controls underwent intrapartum fetal monitoring. Characteristics found to be associated with an increased risk of cerebral palsy were multiple late decelerations in the heart rate, commonly defined as slowing of the heart rate well after the onset of uterine contractions (odds ratio, 3.9; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.7 to 9.3), and decreased beat-to-beat variability of the heart rate (odds ratio, 2.7; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 5.8); there was no association between the highest or lowest fetal heart rate recorded for each child and the risk of cerebral palsy. Even after adjustment for other risk factors, the association of abnormalities on fetal monitoring with an increased risk of cerebral palsy persisted (adjusted odds ratio, 2.7; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 5.4). The 21 children with cerebral palsy who had multiple late decelerations or decreased variability in heart rate on fetal monitoring represented only 0.19 percent of singleton infants with birth weights of 2500 g or more who had these fetal-monitoring findings, for a false positive rate of 99.8 percent. Conclusions Specific abnormal findings on electronic monitoring of the fetal heart rate were associated with an increased risk of cerebral palsy. However, the false positive rate was extremely high. Since cesarean section is often performed when such abnormalities are noted and is associated with risk to the mother, our findings arouse concern that, if these indications were widely used, many cesarean sections would be performed without benefit and with the potential for harm.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a systematic and computable method for choosing the regularization parameter appearing in Tikhonov-type regularization based on non-quadratic regularizers. First, we extend the notion of the L-curve, originally defined for quadratically regularized problems, to the case of non-quadratic functions. We then associate the optimal value of the regularization parameter for these non-quadratic problems with the corner of the resulting generalized L-curve. We identify the corner of this L-curve as the point of tangency between a straight line of arbitrary slope and the L-curve. This definition results in a corresponding algebraic equation which the optimal regularization parameter must satisfy. This algebraic equation naturally leads to an iterative algorithm for the optimal value of the regularization parameter. The convergence of this iterative algorithm is established. Simulation results confirm that the proposed method yields values of the regularization parameters that result in good reconstructions for non-quadratic problems},

  Abstract                 = {In order to establish both positional and size data for estimation of fetal absorbed dose from radiological examinations, the depth from the mother's anterior surface to the mid-line of the fetal head and abdomen were measured from ultrasound scans in 215 pregnant women. Depths were measured along a ray path projected in the anteroposterior (AP) direction from the mother's abdomen. The fetal size was estimated from measurements of the fetal abdominal and head circumference, femur length and the biparietal diameter. The effects of fetal presentation, maternal bladder volume, placenta location, gestational age and maternal AP thickness on fetal depth and size were analysed. The fetal position from the anterior surface of the mother's abdomen is shorter for posterior placenta and empty bladder volume, but longer for anterior placenta and full bladder volume. Mean fetal depth (MFD) observed for all bladder volumes, fetal presentations and placenta locations increased from 6.5 +/- 0.5 cm to 10.2 +/- 0.7 cm over the duration of pregnancy. Similarly, mean fetal skull depth (FSD) increased from 6.6 +/- 0.6 cm to 9.8 +/- 0.6 cm over the period of pregnancy, but only from about 6.6 cm to 7.8 cm over the period (8-25 weeks) when damage to the developing brain has been observed to result in mental retardation. Using the range of mean fetal depth (4.7-13.9 cm) observed in this study and depth dose data at 75 kVp and 3.0 mmAl half value thickness (HVT), fetal absorbed dose would be overestimated by up to 66\% or underestimated by up to 77\% if the mean value of MFD (8.1 cm) is used rather than actual individual values. These errors increase with lower tube potential and filtration up to over 90\% overestimation and up to 100\% underestimation at 60 kVp and 1.0 mmAl filtration.},

In this paper the real-time implementation of a block-on-line independent component analysis (ICA) algorithm for FECG extraction is presented and evaluated over real long lasting recordings. The problem of the signals permutation, typical of ICA algorithms and particularly severe for block-on-line ones, is analyzed in detail. The comparison with batch approaches applied to different segments of the signals demonstrates the quality of the proposed solution. The performances of the real-time implementation enable further developments of the system to automatically provide other interesting clinical parameters.},

However, it is a simple matter to take advantage of possible nonstationarities of the sources to achieve separation. This paper develops novel approaches in this direction based on the principles of maximum likelihood and minimum mutual information. These principles are exploited by efficient algorithms in both the off-line case (via a new joint diagonalization procedure) and in the on-line case (via a Newton-like procedure). Some experiments showing the good performance of our algorithms and evidencing an interesting feature of our methods are presented: their ability to achieve a kind of super-efficiency. The paper concludes with a discussion contrasting separating methods for non-Gaussian and nonstationary models and emphasizing that, as a matter of fact, ?what makes the algorithms work? is-strictly speaking-not the nonstationarity itself but rather the property that each realization of the source signals has a time-varying envelope},

	abstract = {Background The study of cerebral activity during sleep using the electroencephalograph (EEG) is a major research field in neuroscience. Despite the rich literature in this field, the automatic and accurate categorization of wake-sleep stages remains an open problem.New Method A robust model-based Kalman filtering scheme is proposed for tracking the poles of a second order time-varying autoregressive model fitted over the EEG acquired during different wake/sleep stages. The pole angle/phase is regarded as the dominant frequency of the EEG spectrum (known as the instantaneous frequency in literature). The frequency resolution is improved by splitting the wide frequency band to subbands corresponding to well-known brain rhythms. Using recent findings in field of EEG phase/frequency tracking, the instantaneous envelope of the narrow-band signal{\textquoteright}s analytic form is also tracked as a complementary feature.Results The minimal set of instantaneous frequency and envelope features is employed in three classification schemes, using training labels from R\&amp;k and AASM sleep scoring standards. The LDA classifier resulted in the highest performance using the proposed feature set.Comparison with Existing Methods The proposed method resulted in a higher mean decoding accuracy and a lower standard deviation on the entire dataset, as compared with state-of-the-art techniques.Conclusions The accurate tracking of the instantaneous frequency and envelope are highly informative for sleep stage scoring. The proposed method is shown to have additional applications, including the prediction of wake-sleep transition, which can be used for drowsiness detection from the EEG.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The standard Gaussian function is proposed for the hemodynamic modulation function (HDMF) of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time-series. Unlike previously proposed parametric models, the Gaussian model accounts independently for the delay and dispersion of the hemodynamic responses and provides a more flexible and mathematically convenient model. A suboptimal noniterative scheme to estimate the hemodynamic parameters is presented. The ability of the Gaussian function to represent the HDMF of brain activation is compared with Poisson and Gamma models. The proposed model seems valid because the lag and dispersion values of hemodynamic responses rendered by the Gaussian model are in the ranges of their previously reported values in recent optical and fMR imaging studies.An extension of multiple regression analysis to incorporate the HDMF is presented. The detected activity patterns exhibit improvements with hemodynamic correction. The proposed model and efficient parameter estimation scheme facilitated the investigation of variability of hemodynamic parameters of human brain activation. The hemodynamic parameters estimated over different brain regions and across different stimuli showed significant differences. Measurement of hemodynamic parameters over the brain during sensory or cognitive stimulation may reveal vital information on physiological events accompanying neuronal activation and functional variability of the human brain, and should lead to the investigation of more accurate and complex models.

  Abstract                 = {The construction of three-dimensional images of the primary current density (PCD) produced by neuronal activity is a problem of great current interest in the neuroimaging community, though being initially formulated in the 1970s. There exist even now enthusiastic debates about the authenticity of most of the inverse solutions proposed in the literature, in which low resolution electrical tomography (LORETA) is a focus of attention. However, in our opinion, the capabilities and limitations of the electro and magneto encephalographic techniques to determine PCD configurations have not been extensively explored from a theoretical framework, even for simple volume conductor models of the head. In this paper, the electrophysiological inverse problem for the spherical head model is cast in terms of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) formalism, which allows us to identify the null spaces of the implicated linear integral operators and also to define their representers. The PCD are described in terms of a continuous basis for the RKHS, which explicitly separates the harmonic and non-harmonic components. The RKHS concept permits us to bring LORETA into the scope of the general smoothing splines theory. A particular way of calculating the general smoothing splines is illustrated, avoiding a brute force discretization prematurely. The Bayes information criterion is used to handle dissimilarities in the signal/noise ratios and physical dimensions of the measurement modalities, which could affect the estimation of the amount of smoothness required for that class of inverse solution to be well specified. In order to validate the proposed method, we have estimated the 3D spherical smoothing splines from two data sets: electric potentials obtained from a skull phantom and magnetic fields recorded from subjects performing an experiment of human faces recognition.},

  Abstract                 = {Eye movement artifacts represent a critical issue for quantitative electroencephalography ({EEG}) analysis and a number of mathematical approaches have been proposed to reduce their contribution in {EEG} recordings. The aim of this paper was to objectively and quantitatively evaluate the performance of ocular filtering methods with respect to spectral target variables widely used in clinical and functional {EEG} studies. In particular the following methods were applied: regression analysis and some blind source separation (BSS) techniques based on second-order statistics (PCA, AMUSE and SOBI) and on higher-order statistics (JADE, INFOMAX and FASTICA). Considering blind source decomposition methods, a completely automatic procedure of BSS based on logical rules related to spectral and topographical information was proposed in order to identify the components related to ocular interference. The automatic procedure was applied in different montages of simulated {EEG} and electrooculography (EOG) recordings: a full montage with 19 {EEG} and 2 EOG channels, a reduced one with only 6 {EEG} leads and a third one where EOG channels were not available. Time and frequency results in all of them indicated that AMUSE and SOBI algorithms preserved and recovered more brain activity than the other methods mainly at anterior regions. In the case of full montage: (i) errors were lower than 5\% for all spectral variables at anterior sites; and (ii) the highest improvement in the signal-to-artifact (SAR) ratio was obtained up to 40dB at these anterior sites. Finally, we concluded that second-order BSS-based algorithms (AMUSE and SOBI) provided an effective technique for eye movement removal even when EOG recordings were not available or when data length was short.},

Specifically, three types of \{ECG\} modeling techniques, including polynomial spline models, sinusoidal model and a model previously presented by McSharry et al., are studied within this framework. The proposed method is applied to datasets from the PhysioNet \{ECG\} database for compression and modeling of normal and abnormal \{ECG\} signals. Quantitative and qualitative results of these applications are also presented and discussed.},

We assume an additive model for the noise corrupting the clean signal. The proposed formulation is general in the sense that it can handle various noise distributions. We consider various noise distributions (Gaussian, Student's-t, and Laplacian) and compare the denoising performance of the estimator obtained with the mean-squared error (MSE)-based estimators. The MSE optimization is carried out using an unbiased estimator of the MSE, namely Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (SURE).

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In this work, a block-wise extension of Tikhonov regularization is proposed for denoising smooth signals contaminated by wide-band noise. The proposed method is derived from a constrained least squares problem in two forms: 1) a block-wise fixed-lag smoother with smooth inter-block transitions applied in matrix form, and 2) a fixed-interval smoother applied as a forward-backward zero-phase filter. The filter response is maximally flat and monotonically decreasing, without any ripples in its pass-band. The method is also extended to smoothness of multiple smoothness orders, and its relationship with Lipschitz regularity and block-wise Wiener smoothing is also studied. The denoising of normal and abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) signals in different stationary and non-stationary noise levels is studied as case study. While most ECG denoising techniques benefit from the pseudo-periodicity of the ECG, the developed technique is merely based on the smoothness assumption, which makes it a powerful method for both normal and abnormal ECG. The performance of the method is assessed by Monte-Carlo simulations over three standard normal and abnormal ECG databases of different sampling rates, in comparison with bandpass filtering, wavelet denoising with various parameters, and Savitzky-Golay filters using Stein's unbiased risk estimate shrinkage scheme.},

abstract="The fetal electrocardiogram (fECG) was first recorded from the maternal abdominal surface in the early 1900s. During the past 50 years, the most advanced electronics technologies and signal processing algorithms have been used to convert noninvasive fetal electrocardiography into a reliable technology for fetal cardiac monitoring. In this chapter, the major signal processing techniques, which have been developed for the modeling, extraction, and analysis of the fECG from noninvasive maternal abdominal recordings, are reviewed and compared with one another in detail. The major topics of the chapter include (1) the electrophysiology of the fECG from the signal processing viewpoint, (2) the mathematical model of the maternal volume conduction media and the waveform models of the fECG acquired from body surface leads, (3) the signal acquisition requirements, (4) model-based techniques for fECG noise and interference cancellation, including adaptive filters and semi-blind source separation techniques, and (5) recent algorithmic advances for fetal motion tracking and online fECG extraction from few number of channels.",

It is shown that the method is an improved extension of conventional source separation techniques, specifically customized for ECG signals. The method is therefore of special interest for the decomposition and compression of multichannel ECG, and for the removal of maternal ECG artifacts from fetal ECG recordings.},

  Abstract                 = {Objective: The instantaneous phase (IP) and instantaneous frequency (IF) of the electroencephalogram (EEG) are considered as notable complements for the EEG spectrum. The calculation of these parameters commonly includes narrow-band filtering, followed by the calculation of the signal?s analytical form. The calculation of the IP and IF is highly susceptible to the filter parameters and background noise level, especially in low analytical signal amplitudes. The objective of this study is to propose a robust statistical framework for EEG IP/IF estimation and analysis. Approach: Herein, a Monte Carlo estimation scheme is proposed for the robust estimation of the EEG IP and IF. It is proposed that any EEG phase-related inference should be reported as an average with confidence intervals obtained by repeating the IP and IF estimation under infinitesimal variations (selected by an expert), in algorithmic parameters such as the filter?s bandwidth, center frequency and background noise level. In the second part of the paper, a stochastic model consisting of the superposition of narrow-band foreground and background EEG is used to derive analytically probability density functions of the instantaneous envelope (IE) and IP of EEG signals, which justify the proposed Monte Carlo scheme. Main results: The instantaneous analytical envelope of the EEG, which has been empirically used in previous studies, is shown to have a fundamental impact on the accuracy of the EEG phase contents. It is rigorously shown that the IP/IF estimation quality highly depends on the IE and any phase/frequency interpretations in low IE are statistically unreliable and require a hypothesis test. Significance: The impact of the proposed method on previous studies, including time-domain phase synchrony, phase resetting, phase locking value and phase amplitude coupling are studied with examples. The findings of this research can set forth new standards for EEG phase/frequency estimation and analysis techniques.},

The method is based on a modified nonlinear dynamic model, previously introduced for the generation of synthetic ECG signals. We have suggested simple dynamics as the governing equations for the model parameters. Since we have not any observation for these new state variables, they are considered as hidden states. Quantitative evaluation of the proposed algorithm on the MIT-BIH signals shows that an average SNR improvement of 12 dB is achieved for a signal of -5 dB. The results show improved output SNRs compared to the EKF outputs in the absence of these new dynamics.},

  Abstract                 = {In much of modern radar, sonar, and wireless communication, it seems more reasonable to model "measurement noise" as subspace interference-plus-broadband noise than as colored noise. This observation leads naturally to a variety of detection and estimation problems in the linear statistical model. To solve these problems, one requires oblique pseudo-inverses, oblique projections, and zero-forcing orthogonal projections. The problem is that these operators depend on knowledge of signal and interference subspaces, and this information is often not at hand. More typically, the signal subspace is known, but the interference subspace is unknown. We prove a theorem that allows these operators to be estimated directly from experimental data, without knowledge of the interference subspace. As a byproduct, the theorem shows how signal subspace covariance may be estimated. When the strict identities of the theorem are approximated, then the detectors, estimators, and beamformers of this paper take on the form of adaptive subspace estimators, detectors, and Capon beamformers, all of which are reduced in rank. The fundamental operator turns out to be a certain reduced-rank Wiener filter, which we clarify in the course of our derivations. The results of this paper form a foundation for the rapid adaptation of receivers that are then used for detection and estimation. They may be applied to detection and estimation in radar, sonar, and hyperspectral imaging and to data decoding in multiuser communication receivers.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: A fully automated method for reducing EOG artifacts is presented and validated. METHODS: The correction method is based on regression analysis and was applied to 18 recordings with 22 channels and approx. 6 min each. Two independent experts scored the original and corrected EEG in a blinded evaluation. RESULTS: The expert scorers identified in 5.9\% of the raw data some EOG artifacts; 4.7\% were corrected. After applying the EOG correction, the expert scorers identified in another 1.9\% of the data some EOG artifacts, which were not recognized in the uncorrected data. CONCLUSIONS: The advantage of a fully automated reduction of EOG artifacts justifies the small additional effort of the proposed method and is a viable option for reducing EOG artifacts. The method has been implemented for offline and online analysis and is available through BioSig, an open source software library for biomedical signal processing. SIGNIFICANCE: Visual identification and rejection of EOG-contaminated EEG segments can miss many EOG artifacts, and is therefore not sufficient for removing EOG artifacts. The proposed method was able to reduce EOG artifacts by 80\%.},

  Abstract                 = {Magnetoencephalography (MEG) using auditory evoked cortical fields (AEF) is an absolutely non-invasive method of passive measurement which utilizes magnetic fields caused by specific cortical activity. By applying the exceptionally sensitive SQUID technology to record these fields of dipolar configuration produced by the fetal brain, MEG as an investigational tool could provide new insights into the development of the human brain in utero. The major constraint to this application is a very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that has to be attributed to a variety of factors including the magnetic signals generated by the fetal and maternal hearts which inevitably obscure a straightforward signal analysis. By applying a new algorithm of specific heart artefact reduction based on the relative regularity of the heart signals, we were able to increase the chance of extracting a fetal AEF from the raw data by the means of averaging techniques and principle component analysis. Results from 27 pregnant, healthy women (third trimester of their uncomplicated pregnancy) indicate an improved detection rate and the reproducibility of the fetal MEG. We evaluate and discuss a-priori criteria for signal analyses which will enable us to systematically analyze additional limiting factors, to further enhance the efficiency of this method and to promote the assessment of its possible clinical value in the future.},

This method is based on the principle of generalized Wiener estimation, and it is formulated based on the assumption that current sources are uncorrelated. Computer simulation demonstrates that the proposed method can reconstruct a 3-D current distribution where the conventional least-squares minimum-norm method fails. The influence of noise is also simulated, and the results indicate that a signal-to-noise ratio of more than 20 for the uncorrelated sensor noise is needed to implement the proposed method. The calculated point spread function shows that the proposed method has very high spatial resolution compared to the conventional minimum norm method. The results of computer simulation of the distributed current sources are also presented, including cases where current sources are correlated. These results suggest that no serious errors arise if the source correlation is weak.},

  Abstract                 = {Objective: In this study, a robust method is developed for frequency-specific electroencephalogram (EEG) phase extraction using the analytic representation of the EEG. Based on recent theoretical findings in this area, it is shown that some of the phase variations?previously associated to the brain response?are systematic side-effects of the methods used for EEG phase calculation, especially during low analytical amplitude segments of the EEG. Approach: With this insight, the proposed method generates randomized ensembles of the EEG phase using minor perturbations in the zero-pole loci of narrow-band filters, followed by phase estimation using the signal?s analytical form and ensemble averaging over the randomized ensembles to obtain a robust EEG phase and frequency. This Monte Carlo estimation method is shown to be very robust to noise and minor changes of the filter parameters and reduces the effect of fake EEG phase jumps, which do not have a cerebral origin. Main results: As proof of concept, the proposed method is used for extracting EEG phase features for a brain computer interface (BCI) application. The results show significant improvement in classification rates using rather simple phase-related features and a standard K-nearest neighbors and random forest classifiers, over a standard BCI dataset. Significance: The average performance was improved between 4?7% (in absence of additive noise) and 8?12% (in presence of additive noise). The significance of these improvements was statistically confirmed by a paired sample t-test , with 0.01 and 0.03 p-values, respectively. The proposed method for EEG phase calculation is very generic and may be applied to other EEG phase-based studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Antepartum fetal monitoring based on the classical cardiotocography (CTG) is a noninvasive and simple tool for checking fetal status. Its introduction in the clinical routine limited the occurrence of fetal problems leading to a reduction of the precocious child mortality. Nevertheless, very poor indications on fetal pathologies can be inferred from the even automatic CTG analysis methods, which are actually employed. The feeling is that fetal heart rate (FHR) signals and uterine contractions carry much more information on fetal state than is usually extracted by classical analysis methods. In particular, FHR signal contains indications about the neural development of the fetus. However, the methods actually adopted for judging a CTG trace as "abnormal" give weak predictive indications about fetal dangers. We propose a new methodological approach for the CTG monitoring, based on a multiparametric FHR analysis, which includes spectral parameters from autoregressive models and nonlinear algorithms (approximate entropy). This preliminary study considers 14 normal fetuses, eight cases of gestational (maternal) diabetes, and 13 intrauterine growth retarded fetuses. A comparison with the traditional time domain analysis is also included. This paper shows that the proposed new parameters are able to separate normal from pathological fetuses. Results constitute the first step for realizing a new clinical classification system for the early diagnosis of most common fetal pathologies.},

In practice, real time acquisition and transmission of the \{ECG\} may contain noise signals superimposed on it. In general, the signal processing algorithms employed for denoising provide optimal performance and eliminate the high frequency noise between any two beats contained in a continuous \{ECG\} signal. Despite their optimal performance, the signal processing algorithms significantly attenuate the peaks of characteristics wave of the \{ECG\} signal. This paper presents a selection procedure of mother wavelet basis functions applied for denoising of the \{ECG\} signal in wavelet domain while retaining the signal peaks close to their full amplitude. The obtained wavelet based denoised \{ECG\} signals retain the necessary diagnostics information contained in the original \{ECG\} signal.},

A statistical signal model is developed which accounts for such movements by means of scaling, rotation, and time synchronization of vector-cardiographic loops. The maximum-likelihood estimator of the parameters describing these three transformations is presented and is extended to the case of multiple loop alignment. The performance of the method is assessed by measuring morphologic variability before and after loop alignment. It is shown that the effects of respiration on morphologic variability can be considerably reduced by the new method. Measurements on morphologic variability were typically reduced by a factor of 0.53 after loop alignment. The results show also that beat-to-beat measurements are strongly dependent on the selected sampling rate and that a rate of 1 kHz is too low},

  Abstract                 = {Electroencephalogram (EEG) data acquired in the MRI scanner contains significant artifacts, one of the most prominent of which is ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifact. BCG artifacts are generated by movement of EEG electrodes inside the magnetic field due to pulsatile changes in blood flow tied to the cardiac cycle. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a statistical algorithm that is useful for removing artifacts that are linearly and independently mixed with signals of interest. Here, we demonstrate and validate the usefulness of ICA in removing BCG artifacts from EEG data acquired in the MRI scanner. In accordance with our hypothesis that BCG artifacts are physiologically independent from EEG, it was found that ICA consistently resulted in five to six independent components representing the BCG artifact. Following removal of these components, a significant reduction in spectral power at frequencies associated with the BCG artifact was observed. We also show that our ICA-based procedures perform significantly better than noise-cancellation methods that rely on estimation and subtraction of averaged artifact waveforms from the recorded EEG. Additionally, the proposed ICA-based method has the advantage that it is useful in situations where ECG reference signals are corrupted or not available.}

  abstract  = {A two-pass adaptive filtering algorithm is proposed for cancellation of recurrent interferences such as the heart interference in biomedical signals. In the first pass, an average waveform in one period of the interference is estimated by event-synchronous (QRS-synchronous) averaging of the corrupted signal. In a second pass, an adaptive Schur recursive least squares (RLS) lattice filter is used to cancel the interference by using the event synchronously repeated estimated average waveform of the interference as an artificial reference signal. One key feature of this approach is that the ECG is only used for QRS synchronization and not directly as a reference signal for adaptive filtering. Thus the proposed algorithm can be applied to interference problems where ECG and true interference are almost synchronous but show considerably different waveforms. This is usually the case with the heart interference in biomedical signals. Both off-line and real-time implementations of the event synchronous interference canceller are described. The method is applied to the cancellation of the heart interference in magnetoencephalogram (MEG) signals and to the effective isolation of ventricular extrasystoles (VES) in magnetocardiogram (MCG) signals. Experimental results are shown. The new method typically attenuates the amplitudes of R-wave and T-wave interference components by an amplitude factor of 30 without influencing the MEG events of interest.},

These data are classically characterized by recording response patterns to any kind of stimulation mixed with any degree of noise levels. Here, we want to detect the underlying signal sources such as these experimental responses in an unbiased fashion, and therefore extend and employ a source separation technique based on temporal autodecorrelation. Our extension first centers the data using a multivariate median, and then separates the sources based on approximate joint diagonalization of multiple sign autocovariance matrices.},

  Abstract                 = {A novel second-order-statistics-based sequential blind extraction algorithm for blind extraction of quasi-periodic signals, with time-varying period, is introduced in this paper. Source extraction is performed by sequentially converging to a solution that effectively diagonalizes autocorrelation matrices at lags corresponding to the time-varying period, which thereby explicitly exploits a key statistical nonstationary characteristic of the desired source. The algorithm is shown to have fast convergence and yields significant improvement in signal-to-interference ratio as compared to when the algorithm assumes a fixed period. The algorithm is further evaluated on the problem of separation of a heart sound signal from real-world lung sound recordings. Separation results confirm the utility of the introduced approach, and listening tests are employed to further corroborate the results.},

  Abstract                 = {A common problem in disciplines such as high energy physics, biomedicine and acoustic signal processing is finding a suitable representation of multivariate data. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a recently developed mathematical tool that can recover independent source signals and is now mature enough to be implemented in real-time applications such as photomultipliers signal processing, magnetic resonance imaging and acoustic arrays. This technique is based on the assumption that signals from different sources are statistically independent and statistically independent signals can be extracted from mixture signals. ICA defines a model for the observed data that requires a large number of samples in order to establish the necessary statistics. The model assumes that the data variables are linear combination of unknown variables, the unknown variables are assumed to be non-Gaussian and independent. The goal then becomes to find a transformation in which the components are as statistical independent as possible from each other. This technique is related with methods such as principal component analysis and factor analysis. The ICA algorithm is computing intensive since it must accumulate and go through the signal samples performing complex operations. Efficient versions of the algorithm have being already deployed using different techniques such as the FastICA that can be implemented efficiently in hardware platforms such as DSP processors and FPGA's. In this paper, we present the ICA principles, implementation and current applications.},

In case of a periodic disturbing signal, special solutions are described in literature. Problems, however, arise when the propagation of the noise from the source to the recording sensors passes nonlinear structures. An ANC modification proposed for this case by Strobach and applied by several other researchers, thus, uses an artificial reference signal, based on event triggered averaging of segments of the recorded wanted (but disturbed) signal in order to obtain a template for the repetitive distortion sequence and to construct the artificial reference signal. The effect of the averaging and the error introduced by this approximation of the real disturbing signal was not addressed in literature until now, thus, this paper presents some basic theoretical considerations on this topic. Methods are demonstrated in simulations and real biosignal processing, and application aspects are discussed},

Therefore, conventional signal processing methods can be used to study the HR signal easily and without any preprocessing techniques like resampling and interpolations used in previous method.},

  Abstract                 = {FHR monitoring has been the subject of many debates. The technique, in itself, can be considered to be accurate and reliable both in the antenatal period, when using the Doppler signal in combination with autocorrelation techniques, and during the intrapartum period, in particular when the FHR signal can be obtained from a fetal ECG electrode placed on the presenting part. The major problems with FHR monitoring relate to the reading and interpretation of the CTG tracings. Since the FHR pattern is primarily an expression of the activity of the control by the central and peripheral nervous system over cardiovascular haemodynamics, it is possibly too indirect a signal. In other specialities such as neonatology, anaesthesiology and cardiology, monitoring and graphic display of heart rate patterns have not gained wide acceptance among clinicians. Digitized archiving, numerical analysis and even more advanced techniques, as described in this chapter, have primarily found a place in obstetrics. This can be easily explained, since the obstetrician is fully dependent on indirectly collected information regarding the fetal condition, such as (a) movements experienced by the mother, observed with ultrasound or recorded with kinetocardiotocography (Schmidt, 1994), (b) perfusion of various vessels, as assessed by Doppler velocimetry, (c) the amount of amniotic fluid or (d) changes reflected in the condition of the mother, such as the development of gestation-induced hypertension and (e) the easily, continuously obtainable FHR signal. It is of particular comfort to the obstetrician that a normal FHR tracing reliably predicts the birth of the infant in a good condition, which makes cardiotocography so attractive for widespread application. However, in the intrapartum period, many traces cannot fulfil the criteria of normality, especially in the second stage. In this respect, cardiotocography remains primarily a screening and not so much a diagnostic method. As long as continuous monitoring of fetal acid-base balance has not been extensively tested in clinical practice, microblood sampling of the fetal presenting part (Saling, 1994) is a useful adjunct. The problem with non-normal tracings is that their significance is very often unclear. They may indicate serious fetal distress, finally resulting in preventable destruction of critical areas in the fetal brain and damage to various organs; or, on the contrary, they may indicate temporary changes in cardiovascular control as a reaction to the intermittent effects on fetal haemodynamics of, for example, uterine contractions, whether or not in combination with partial or complete compression of umbilical cord vessels or the vessels on the chorionic plate (van Geijn, 1994). Many factors influence the FHR and its variability, which further complicates the interpretation of FHR patterns; some have been discussed here in some detail. Undoubtedly, there is a need for quantitative and objective FHR analysis, as long as it does not lead to erroneous results. Close collaboration between engineers and clinicians is a prerequisite for further advances in this field. Decision support systems certainly have a future but only if they are able to take into account a large set of clinical data and can combine it with data obtained from FHR signals and other parameters referring to the fetal condition, such as fetal growth, Doppler velocimetry, amniotic fluid volume and biochemical and biophysical data obtained from the mother. Basic technical concepts inherent in computerized CTG analysis, such as sampling rate (Chang et al, 1995), signal loss, artefact detection (van Geijn et al, 1980), further processing of intervals, archiving in digitized format and monitor display, should receive considerable attention. There is still a long way to go until decision support systems find their way into obstetric practice. Further developments can only be achieved thanks to efforts of many basic and clinical researchers, working in a harmonious environment with adequate funding.},

  Abstract                 = {Aim of this study was the examination of fetal heart rate variability and complexity measures during pregnancy using fetal magnetocardiography. We registered 80 fetal magnetocardiograms in 19 healthy fetuses between the 16th and 41st week of gestation. On the basis of beat to beat intervals, mean RR interval (mRR), its standard deviation (SD), root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), as well as complexity variables such as dimension (ApD1), entropy (ApEn), Lyapunov exponent (ApML) and trajectory divergence rate (p) were calculated for each recording. Dependency of these variables on gestational age was evaluated with correlation analysis. All variables changed consistently over time. RMSSD showed the strongest dependency on gestational age, followed closely by ApEn, SD and p. ApD1 and mRR showed only weak dependency. We conclude that magnetocardiography is well suited to register fetal cardiac activity with sufficient accuracy to permit detailed analysis of various heart rate variables during the second and third trimester of pregnancy. The observed increases in heart rate variability and complexity of fetuses most likely reflect differing but overlapping aspects of fetal development. They may be linked to the maturation of the autonomic nervous system and could aid in the timely identification of pathological conditions.},

  abstract    = {Neuronal oscillations are an important aspect of EEG recordings. These oscillations are supposed to be involved in several cognitive mechanisms. For instance, oscillatory activity is considered a key component for the top-down control of perception. However, measuring this activity and its influence requires precise extraction of frequency components. This processing is not straightforward. Particularly, difficulties with extracting oscillations arise due to their time-varying characteristics. Moreover, when phase information is needed, it is of the utmost importance to extract narrow-band signals. This paper presents a novel method using adaptive filters for tracking and extracting these time-varying oscillations. This scheme is designed to maximize the oscillatory behavior at the output of the adaptive filter. It is then capable of tracking an oscillation and describing its temporal evolution even during low amplitude time segments. Moreover, this method can be extended in order to track several oscillations simultaneously and to use multiple signals. These two extensions are particularly relevant in the framework of EEG data processing, where oscillations are active at the same time in different frequency bands and signals are recorded with multiple sensors. The presented tracking scheme is first tested with synthetic signals in order to highlight its capabilities. Then it is applied to data recorded during a visual shape discrimination experiment for assessing its usefulness during EEG processing and in detecting functionally relevant changes. This method is an interesting additional processing step for providing alternative information compared to classical time-frequency analyses and for improving the detection and analysis of cross-frequency couplings.},

However, the main problem associated with this method is that the signals recorded from the maternal abdomen are affected by noise and interferences: the maternal electrocardiogram (mECG) being the dominant interference. In this paper a mECG removal technique is described, which is based on dynamic segmentation of the mECG and subsequent linear prediction of the mECG segments. Moreover, as the linear prediction is significantly affected by artifacts, a signal validation technique is presented to suppress the effect of artifacts on the mECG prediction. The performance of the presented technique is evaluated by comparison to the performance of three other mECG removal techniques: the presented technique outperforms the other techniques for all recordings.},

  Abstract                 = {Fetal magnetocardiography (fMCG) offers unique capabilities for assessment of fetal heart rate (FHR) and fetal behavior, which are fundamental aspects of neurodevelopment. The most important attribute of fMCG for FHR monitoring is its high precision, which allows accurate assessment of beat-to-beat fetal heart rate variability (FHRV), including respiratory sinus arrhythmia. Using mathematical indices to assess FHRV, we find that short- and long-term FHRV both increase during gestation but not in the same manner. The largest increases in short-term FHRV occur during the last trimester, while the largest increases in long-term FHRV occur early on, with smaller changes occurring during the last trimester. The fMCG also allows assessment of fetal activity. This results from the high sensitivity of the signal to the position and orientation of the fetal heart. FMCG actograms are therefore specific for fetal trunk movement, which are thought to be more important than isolated extremity movements and other small fetal movements. The ability to assess FHR, FHRV, and fetal trunk movement simultaneously makes fMCG a valuable tool for neurodevelopment research.},

  Abstract                 = {Objective We present a new method of effectively removing imaging artifacts of electroencephalography (EEG) and extensively conserving the time-frequency features of EEG signals during simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning under conventional conditions.Methods Under the conventional conditions of a 5000 Hz EEG sampling rate, but in the absence of the MRI slice-timing signals, the imaging artifact during each slice scanning is theoretically inferred to be a linear combination of the average artifact waveform and its derivatives, deduced by band-limited Taylor's expansion. Technically, the imaging artifact reduction algorithm is equivalent to an adaptive finite impulse response (FIR) filter.Results The capability of this novel method removing the imaging artifacts of EEG recording during fMRI scanning has been demonstrated by a phantom experiment. Moreover, the effectiveness of this method in conserving the time-frequency features of EEG activity has been evaluated by both visually evoked experiments and alpha waves.Conclusions The adaptive FIR method is an effective method of removing the imaging artifacts under conventional conditions, and also conserving the time-frequency EEG signals.Significance The proposed adaptive FIR method, removing the imaging artifacts, combined with the wavelet-based non-linear noise reduction (WNNR) method [Wan X, Iwata K, Riera J, Ozaki T, Kitamura M, Kawashima R.

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:Cardiotocography (CTG) is worldwide the method for fetal surveillance during labour. However, CTG alone shows many false positive test results and without fetal blood sampling (FBS), it results in an increase in operative deliveries without improvement of fetal outcome. FBS requires additional expertise, is invasive and has often to be repeated during labour. Two clinical trials have shown that a combination of CTG and ST-analysis of the fetal electrocardiogram (ECG) reduces the rates of metabolic acidosis and instrumental delivery. However, in both trials FBS was still performed in the ST-analysis arm, and it is therefore still unknown if the observed results were indeed due to the ST-analysis or to the use of FBS in combination with ST-analysis.METHODS/DESIGN:We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of non-invasive monitoring (CTG + ST-analysis) as compared to normal care (CTG + FBS), in a multicentre randomised clinical trial setting. Secondary aims are: 1) to judge whether ST-analysis of fetal electrocardiogram can significantly decrease frequency of performance of FBS or even replace it; 2) perform a cost analysis to establish the economic impact of the two treatment options.Women in labour with a gestational age [greater than or equal to] 36 weeks and an indication for CTG-monitoring can be included in the trial.Eligible women will be randomised for fetal surveillance with CTG and, if necessary, FBS or CTG combined with ST-analysis of the fetal ECG.The primary outcome of the study is the incidence of serious metabolic acidosis (defined as pH < 7.05 and Bdecf > 12 mmol/L in the umbilical cord artery). Secondary outcome measures are: instrumental delivery, neonatal outcome (Apgar score, admission to a neonatal ward), incidence of performance of FBS in both arms and cost-effectiveness of both monitoring strategies across hospitals.The analysis will follow the intention to treat principle. The incidence of metabolic acidosis will be compared across both groups. Assuming a reduction of metabolic acidosis from 3.5% to 2.1 %, using a two-sided test with an alpha of 0.05 and a power of 0.80, in favour of CTG plus ST-analysis, about 5100 women have to be randomised. Furthermore, the cost-effectiveness of CTG and ST-analysis as compared to CTG and FBS will be studied.DISCUSSION:This study will provide data about the use of intrapartum ST-analysis with a strict protocol for performance of FBS to limit its incidence. We aim to clarify to what extent intrapartum ST-analysis can be used without the performance of FBS and in which cases FBS is still needed.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER:ISRCTN95732366},

  abstract  = {The aim of this paper is to develop efficient online adaptive algorithms for the generalized eigen-decomposition problem which arises in a variety of modern signal processing applications. First, we reinterpret the generalized eigen-decomposition problem as an unconstrained minimization problem by constructing a novel cost function. Second, by applying projection approximation method and recursive least-square (RLS) technique to the cost function, a parallel adaptive algorithm for a basis for the r-dimensional (r>0) dominant generalized eigen-subspace and a sequential algorithm based on deflation technique for the first r-dominant generalized eigenvectors are derived. These algorithms can be viewed as counterparts of the extended projection approximation subspace tracking (PAST) and PASTd algorithms, respectively. Furthermore, we modify the parallel algorithm to explicitly estimate the first r-generalized eigenvectors in parallel, not the generalized eigen-subspace. More important, the modified parallel algorithm can be used to extract multiple generalized eigenvectors of two nonstationary sequences, while the proposed sequential algorithm lacks this ability because of slow convergence of minor generalized eigenvectors due to error propagation of the deflation technique. Third, following convergence analysis methods for PAST and PASTd, we prove the asymptotic convergence properties of the proposed algorithms. Finally, computer simulations are performed to investigate the accuracy and the speed advantages of the proposed algorithms.},

  Abstract                 = {The problem of the fetal electrocardiogram (FECG) extraction from maternal skin electrode measurements can be modeled from the perspective of blind source separation (BSS). Since no comparison between BSS techniques and other signal processing methods has been made, the authors compare a BSS procedure based on higher-order statistics and Widrow's multireference adaptive noise cancelling approach. As a best-case scenario for this latter method, optimal Wiener-Hopf solutions are considered. Both procedures are applied to real multichannel ECG recordings obtained from a pregnant woman. The experimental outcomes demonstrate the more robust performance of the blind technique and, in turn, verify the validity of the BSS model in this important biomedical application},

  Abstract                 = {A major challenge in applying machine learning methods to Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) is to overcome the on-line non-stationarity of the data blocks. An effective BCI system should be adaptive to and robust against the dynamic variations in brain signals. One solution to it is to adapt the model parameters of BCI system online. However, CSP is poor at adaptability since it is a batch type algorithm. To overcome this, in this paper, we propose the Incremental Common Spatial Pattern (ICSP) algorithm which performs the adaptive feature extraction on-line. This method allows us to perform the online adjustment of spatial filter. This procedure helps the BCI system robust to possible non-stationarity of the EEG data. We test our method to data from BCI motor imagery experiments, and the results demonstrate the good performance of adaptation of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract = {An electrocardiogram (ECG) compression algorithm, called analysis by synthesis ECG compressor (ASEC), is introduced. The ASEC algorithm is based on analysis by synthesis coding, and consists of a beat codebook, long and short-term predictors, and an adaptive residual quantizer. The compression algorithm uses a defined distortion measure in order to efficiently encode every heartbeat, with minimum bit rate, while maintaining a predetermined distortion level. The compression algorithm was implemented and tested with both the percentage rms difference (PRD) measure and the recently introduced weighted diagnostic distortion (WDD) measure. The compression algorithm has been evaluated with the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. A mean compression rate of approximately 100 bits/s (compression ratio of about 30:1) has been achieved with a good reconstructed signal quality (WDD below 4% and PRD below 8%). The ASEC was compared with several well-known ECG compression algorithms and was found to be superior at all tested bit rates. A mean opinion score (MOS) test was also applied. The testers were three independent expert cardiologists. As In the quantitative test, the proposed compression algorithm was found to be superior to the other tested compression algorithms.},

abstract="In this work, we analytically study the peaking phenomenon in the context of linear discriminant analysis in the multivariate Gaussian model under the assumption of a common known covariance matrix. The focus is finite-sample setting where the sample size and observation dimension are comparable. Therefore, in order to study the phenomenon in such a setting, we use an asymptotic technique whereby the number of sample points is kept comparable in magnitude to the dimensionality of observations. The analysis provides a more thorough picture of the phenomenon. In particular, the analysis shows that as long as the Relative Cumulative Efficacy of an additional Feature set (RCEF) is greater (less) than the size of this set, the expected error of the classifier constructed using these additional features will be less (greater) than the expected error of the classifier constructed without them. Our result highlights underlying factors of the peaking phenomenon relative to the classifier used in this study and, at the same time, calls into question the classical wisdom around the peaking phenomenon.",
