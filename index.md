## Welcome to my home-page!

I was born in [Shiraz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiraz), a beautiful and historical city in Iran. I hold a bachelor's degree in electronics engineering from [Shiraz University](https://shirazu.ac.ir/), a master's degree in biomedical engineering from [Sharif University of Technology](http://www.en.sharif.edu/), and double PhD degrees in biomedical engineering from [Sharif University of Technology](http://www.en.sharif.edu/) and in signal processing and telecommunications from [Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble (INPG)](https://www.grenoble-inp.fr/). I served as a tenured faculty member and Chair at the Department of CSE, BME, and IT at [Shiraz University](https://shirazu.ac.ir/) from 2008 to 2018, and as an invited senior researcher at [GIPSA-lab, Grenoble Alpes University](https://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/en) from 2018 to 2020, before joining [Emory University](https://www.emory.edu/) in 2020. I am currently an associate professor in the [Department of Biomedical Informatics at Emory University](https://med.emory.edu/departments/biomedical-informatics/index.html), and an adjunct associate professor in the [Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology](https://bme.gatech.edu/bme/). I also serve as the Scientific Director of the [Medical Imaging, Informatics, and AI (MIIAI) Core at Emory University School of Medicine](https://www.cores.emory.edu/miiai/).

My research focuses on biomedical signal processing and model-based machine learning. I also have hands-on experience in electronics and telecommunications, with industrial collaborations on digital systems design (including FPGA and embedded systems) and biomedical software and hardware development. Please visit my [lab webpage](https://sameni.org) for further details on my team's research. Feel free to contact me if you are interested in joining my research team or would like to collaborate on any of our current or previous research topics:
