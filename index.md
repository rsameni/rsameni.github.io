Welcome to my home-page!

I am from [Shiraz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiraz), a beautiful and historical city of Iran. I pursued a double PhD degree in signal processing and biomedical engineering from the [Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble (INPG)](https://www.grenoble-inp.fr/) in France and [Sharif University of Technology](http://www.en.sharif.edu/) in Iran. Throughout my career, I have been on faculty at the Department of CSEIT at [Shiraz University](https://shirazu.ac.ir/) for ten years, an invited researcher at [GIPSA-lab](https://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/en) for two years, and currently an associate professor of biomedical informatics at the [Department of Biomedical Informatics, Emory University](https://med.emory.edu/departments/biomedical-informatics/index.html), and adjunct associate professor of biomedical engineering at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://bme.gatech.edu/bme/).

My major is statistical signal processing with special interest in biomedical applications. I also have hands-on experience and active collaborations with industry on digital systems design (FPGA and embedded systems) and biomedical software and hardware development.

Some of my research, courses, publications and open-source codes can be found on this page. Please visit my [lab webpage](https://sameni.org) and contact me if you are interested in joining my research team, or would like to collaborate on any of our current or previous research topics.
