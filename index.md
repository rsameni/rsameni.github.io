## Welcome to my home-page!

I was born in [Shiraz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiraz), a beautiful and historical city in Iran. I hold a bachelor's degree in electronics engineering from [Shiraz University](https://shirazu.ac.ir/), a master's degree in biomedical engineering from [Sharif University of Technology](http://www.en.sharif.edu/), and double PhD degrees in biomedical engineering and in signal processing and telecommunications from [Sharif University of Technology](http://www.en.sharif.edu/) and the [Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble (INPG)](https://www.grenoble-inp.fr/). I served as a faculty member and Chair at the Department of Computer Science \& Engineering, BME and IT at [Shiraz University](https://shirazu.ac.ir/) (2008-2018), and an invited senior researcher at [GIPSA-lab](https://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/en) (2018-2020), before joining the faculty at the [Department of Biomedical Informatics, Emory University](https://med.emory.edu/departments/biomedical-informatics/index.html) in 2020. I am currently an associate professor of the [Department of Biomedical Informatics, Emory University](https://med.emory.edu/departments/biomedical-informatics/index.html), and an adjunct associate professor of the [Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology](https://bme.gatech.edu/bme/). I also serve as the Scientific Director of the [Medical Imaging, Informatics, and AI (MIIAI) Core at Emory University](https://www.cores.emory.edu/miiai/).

My research focuses on biomedical signal processing and model-based machine learning. I also have hands-on experience in electronics and telecommunications, and industrial collaborations on digital systems design (including FPGA and embedded systems) and biomedical software and hardware development.

Some of my research, courses, publications, and open-source codes can be found on this page. Please visit my [lab webpage](https://sameni.org) and contact me if you are interested in joining my research team or would like to collaborate on any of our current or previous research topics.
